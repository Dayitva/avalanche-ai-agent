Create an autonomous AI agent that controls a wallet on the Avalanche network, routinely checks chain information, and uses that information to drive on-chain transactions optimizing for a specific goal.Summary:

Build an AI agent that can understand natural language commands and execute blockchain transactions on the Avalanche network. The agent should interface with a wallet to routinely perform operations based on on-chain data. We highly recommend using __BrianKnows API for LLM Agents__for making transactions.

__Implement the core AI agent that can:   __[Mandatory]

Autonomously and routinely scan on-chain data.

Understand and process on-chain data.

Make a meaningful decision based on said data.

Execute blockchain transactions through a connected wallet.

Optimize it’s decisions for a singular goal/ metric. This goal/ metric is up to you… Have fun ;)

Examples:

Portfolio manager to generate the highest PnL based on given risk parameters (LLM should know how to review risk of LPs, contracts, etc), timeframe and starting $/AVAX.

Portfolio manager to optimize for the highest yield over a given time, utilizing flashloans, multiple risk params etc.

Complete onchain tasks/quests on sites like Galxe, Flipside etc.

__Create a secure wallet integration system that:   __[Mandatory]

Manages private keys securely

Connects to Avalanche network

Handles transaction signing and execution

Performs gas estimation and balance checks

Maintains transaction history

__Implement a basic memory system for:   __[Optional]

Storing user preferences and common addresses

Tracking past interactions and transaction patterns

Managing conversation state

Saving commonly used command patterns.

The completed project should have an autonomous AI agent that manages a wallet that makes decisions towards one central goal. There should be a way to view transaction status/history and document some sort of decision process.

Focus on building a reliable and secure foundation that can be expanded with additional features like multi-chain support, advanced memory systems, or even deploying contracts.
